# Rock Paper Scissors

The purpose of building this game is to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of javaScript by manipulating the DOM to create an interactive project. The game itself is a simple rock paper scissors game. It has an area of choices for the player to choose their move, a placeholder image which changes depending on the players choice and the computers random choice. The score area increments the scores as appropiate and a simple rules section in the footer
