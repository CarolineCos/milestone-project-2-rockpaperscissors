# Rock Paper Scissors

The purpose of building this game is to demonstrate my knowledge and understanding of javaScript by manipulating the DOM to create an interactive project. The game itself is a simple rock paper scissors game. It has an area of choices for the player to choose their move, a placeholder image which changes depending on the players choice and the computers random choice. The score area increments the scores as appropiate and a simple rules section in the footer

# User Experience

When designing this game I was mindful that this is a fun distraction for the visitor so I wanted it to be a bright, fun and simple game.

* The game is set up to be user friendly
* The images display the users and computers choice.
* There is a message displaying the winner and the scores are also incrementing to keep track of the winner.

# Wireframes of website

I used balsamiq to create wireframes for this project.

My inital wireframe for the game was:

However I felt that the design, as I was building it, was too busy so I changed the layout of the choices and score area and adjusted the rule area by removing 'rules' to make it clean and more user friendly.
